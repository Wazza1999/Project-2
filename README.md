## Design

### Colour Scheme

As the pages of the site have a background image, I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site quite small so as to not overwhelm users. Red and green  are very typical colours in traditional British public houses, with the red & green used for upholstery.

In my css file I have used variables to declare colours, and then used these throughout the css file. I was recently introduced to this method during a hackathon - it is a useful convention to use as it allows you to alter the colour throughout the website if you decide to update a colour, by changing the colour once in the variable.

* I have used `#B8860B` & `#000000` as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.
* I have used `#292929` as the overlay used over the sites background image.
* I have used `#a50c3c` for the border of the modal and to display the wrong answers.
* I have used `#047638` to display the correct answer.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title I have used the google font.

!

* For the body of the page I have used the google font 



### Imagery

As the website is called Gotta Quiz Them All!, I wanted to use an image for the page background 
### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

![Game Page]
![High Scores Page]

### Features

The website is comprised of a home page, a games page, a high scores page, a 404 error page & a 500 error page.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

  ![favicon]

* The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page.
  ![Gotta Quiz Them All! Title]

* Every page will display a custom cursor when on a button. This feature is not available on mobile touch devices.

![Custom Cursor]

#### The Home Page

The home page of Gotta Quiz Them All! displays the sites name as a title and then a container which holds some welcome text, including alerting the users that they can navigate back to the home page at any time by clicking on the page name. Below this are three buttons, how to play, play and high scores.

![Home page image]

The how to play  button opens a modal showing the user how to play the game. The modal contains a close button which will close the modal, and show the home page again.

![Modal open image]

The play button will redirect the user to the game page to select the difficulty of their quiz and the high Scores button redirects the user to the high scores page.

#### The Game Page

The game page displays the sites name as a title. This also acts as a link back to the home page. Initially on the game page you will be shown a container with three buttons to select the difficulty of the quiz the user can choose from.

![Image of the game page difficulty selection buttons](documentation/features/difficulty.png)

Once the user has selected their difficulty they will then be shown the quiz area. The quiz area contains the question and the 4  answer choices.

when a user selects an answer, they will then be prevented from selecting any more answers. The quiz area border and the button selected will change styles depending on whether the answer selected was correct or incorrect. If the answer selected was correct, the score counter will add 10 to the score total. When the user clicks the next button the question no counter will increase by 1. If the user selects the wrong answer, the button selected will display red, and the correct answer will display as green.

Once a user has answered the 15 questions they will be taken to the end of the game which will allow them to enter their team name and submit it to be entered onto the high scores page if it is in the top 10 scores. The submit button is disabled by default to prevent the user from submitting without a team name. This is made clear to the user as the cursor will show not allowed when hovered over the submit button.

#### The High Scores Page

The high scores page displays the sites name as a title. This also acts as a link back to the home page. The page then displays the high scores recorded - showing the team name a user chooses and their score. The high scores page will list the top ten scores recorded. Underneath the high scores are two buttons to allow the user to play again or be redirected to the home page.

![High Scores Page Image](documentation/features/highscores.png)

#### The 404 Error Page

The 404 error page displays the sites name as a title. This also acts as a link back to the home page. Within the page container there is a sorry message explaining to the user that there has been an error directing them to the page they were looking for. The user is then given a choice of three buttons to redirect them to other pages on the site, the home page, the games page and the high scores page.

![Error page image](documentation/features/404.png)

#### The 500 Error Page

The 500 error page displays the sites names as a title, which also acts as a link back to the home page. Within the container is an error message that tells the user sorry there seems to be an issue retrieving the quiz data. Two buttons for the home page and the high scores page are below. I did not add the play game button here, as a user will been directed to this page if there is an error calling the API.

![500 Error Page](documentation/features/500.png)

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. Give users the option to select the amount of questions in their quiz.
2. Look into making the quiz a multiplayer game, so that it could be played by teams, which would make the quiz even more like a pub quiz.
3. Create a back end database to enable me to store scores which would then allow you to see how you scored against other players.
4. Look further into the accessibility for people with colour blindness, perhaps by adding symbols such as a tick or cross next to the answer when they are checked.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been have achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Choosing a sans serif font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
